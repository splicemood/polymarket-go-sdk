## Adding New Features

### 1. Design Phase

- Open an issue to discuss the feature
- Consider backward compatibility
- Think about error handling

### 2. Implementation

- Add tests in `*_test.go` files
- Add benchmarks in `*_bench_test.go` if applicable
- Update documentation in `docs/`
- Add examples in `examples/`

### 3. API Design Guidelines

- Use interfaces for flexibility
- Provide sensible defaults
- Include context support for cancellation
- Return structured errors

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, include:
- Go version
- OS/Architecture
- Minimal reproduction code
- Expected vs actual behavior

## Getting Help
